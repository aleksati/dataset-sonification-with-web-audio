## Introduction

The term `Sonification` refers to the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. In this workshop, you will learn how to use sonification together with dynamic images to display multi-dimensional data in a web browser. We will explore these concepts in a creative way but still preserving coherence with the data bring rendered. As a bonus, you will also learn how you can embed web apps onto your personal UiO pages.

## Learning outcomes

- Learn easy-to-use Javascript libraries for dynamic visualization and sonification.
- Learn to creatively map pre-recorded or real-time data and to sound and visuals.
- Learn to integrate data visualization and sonification in a web page.

## Requirements

- Familiarity with any text-based programming language (e.g., if/else statements, loops, arrays, functions, etc.). In the workshop, we will write Javascript code. The workshop is for people interested in data sonification and/or creating computing, wheter it be PhDs, postdocs, other technical personnel and/or students.

- Laptop with a [chromium browser](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)>) (e.g Chrome, Firefox, Brave etc.) and programming-oriented text-editor (e.g [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).

## Setup

You should work directly from the browser via p5's own web editor. Here is how you do it:

1. Download this repository.

2. Create an account on the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

3. Go to "My Sketches" (click on "Hello, username!" on the top right) and create a new sketch.

4. In the web editor of your new sketch, open the sidebar (black arrow on gray backgroun) to access your files.

5. Via the small dropdown menu "Sketch Files" in the left column of the web editor, choose to "upload file" and upload the "arabica_data_cleaned_year.csv" from the data folder.
